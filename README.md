# Project-Mario
Python botnet, Connects to servers via Paramiko


this is a shit project. all the code is pretty broken and shit but have fun ig?

must run client scripts on host server and server scripts on other servers. 

add more servers by copying the code and adding more configs,

dont use these scripts if you are a complete shitter at coding.
